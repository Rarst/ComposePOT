# ComposePOT â€” WordPress POT tools reboot

ComposePOT (`compot`) is a fork of MakePOT tools (and related classes) for working with gettext files from WordPress core.

It aims to decouple said code from WordPress core dependency and sprinkle it with fairy dust of modern PHP and stuff.

So work in progress you have no idea I don't even.
